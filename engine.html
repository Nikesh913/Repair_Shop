                    <p>If the check engine light is on but is steady rather than flashing, this means there's an issue and it's best not to ignore it. Alternatively, a flashing check engine light means the engine is misfiring and unburned fuel is going into the exhaust system. This is a serious problem that can cause damage to the catalytic converter. If the check engine light is on, an engine diagnostic is recommended to avoid costly engine repairs.

                    <h3>FAILING OXYGEN SENSOR</h3>
                    <p>Tucked into your vehicle’s exhaust pipe there are multiple small oxygen sensors that constantly tests the exhaust system to measure the air-to-fuel ratio. The sensor transmits that data to your vehicle’s computer, which relies on this information to create an ideal air-to-fuel mixture based on the driving conditions. Symptoms of a faulty oxygen sensor aren’t obvious to a lot of motorists, so the check engine light may be the first time you become aware that a problem exists. Fixing a serious maintenance problem like a faulty oxygen sensor can improve your vehicle’s fuel efficiency by as much as 40%, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
